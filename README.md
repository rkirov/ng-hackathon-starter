#ng-hackathon-starter

This simple project demonstrates:

* Template Syntax
* Events
* Routing
* Http

It uses the in-browser TypeScript compiler, so no tools are required. Just edit the .ts files.

Big thanks to @robwormald for help with using jspm to bundle up Angular 2 and the dependencies.

## Run it with http-server:

    npm install http-server -g

This will install `http-server` globally so that it may be run from the command line.
#### And then in the project's directory: 

    http-server
